    <abstract>
      <t> The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic
      algorithms in order to provide authentication of DNS data and
      proof of non-existence. To ensure interoperability between DNS
      resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to
      specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage
      guidance to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all
      implementations support. This document defines the current algorithm
      implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">


      <t> The DNSSEC signing algorithms are defined by various RFCs, including [RFC],
      [RFC], [RFC] and is used to provide authentication of data. To ensure
      interoperability, a set of "mandatory-to-implement" DNSKEY algorithms are defined.</t>

     <section title="Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance">
      <t> The field of cryptography evolves continuously. New stronger
      algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found to be less
      secure then originally thought. Therefore, algorithm implementation
      requirements and usage guidance need to be updated from time to
      time to reflect the new reality. The choices for algorithms must
      be conservative to minimize the risk of algorithm compromise. </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels">
      <t> The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should already
      be available in most implementations of DNSSEC by the time it is
      made mandatory. This document attempts to identify and introduce
      those algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement status. There is
      no guarantee that the algorithms in use today may become mandatory
      in the future. Published algorithms are continuously subjected
      to cryptographic attack and may become too weak or could become
      completely broken before this document is updated.</t>

      <t> This document only provides recommendations for the
      mandatory-to-implement algorithms or algorithms too weak that are
      recommended not to be implemented. As a result, any algorithm listed
      at the <xref target="DNSKEY-IANA"/> registry not mentioned in this document MAY be
      implemented. For clarification and consistency, an algorithm will
      be set to MAY only when it has been downgraded.</t>

      <t> Although this document updates the algorithms to keep
      the DNSSEC authentication secure over time, it also aims at
      providing recommendations so that DNSSEC implementations remain
      interoperable. DNSSEC interoperability is addressed by an
      incremental introduction or deprecation of algorithms.</t>

      <t> It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm is performed
      gradually. This provides time for various implementations to update
      their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable. Unless
      there are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to
      be downgraded from MUST to MUST- or SHOULD, instead of MUST
      NOT. Similarly, an algorithm that has not been mentioned as
      mandatory-to-implement is expected to be introduced with a SHOULD
      instead of a MUST.</t>

      <t> Since the effects of using an unknown DNSKEY algorithm
      is for the zone to be treated as insecure, it is recommended
      that algorithms downgraded to SHOULD- or below are no longer used by
      authoritative nameservers and DNSSEC signers to create new DNSKEY's. This
      will allow for algorithms to slowly become more unused over
      time. Once deployment has reached a sufficiently low point these
      algorithms can finally be marked as MUST NOT so that recursive namesvers
      can remove support for these algorithms.</t>

      <t> Recursive nameservers are encouraged to keep support for all
      algorithms not marked as MUST NOT. </t>

     </section>

     <section title="Document Audience">
      <t>The recommendations of this document mostly target DNSSEC
      implementers as implementations need to meet both high security
      expectations as well as high interoperability between various
      vendors and with different versions. Interoperability requires a
      smooth move to more secure algorithms.  This may differ from
      a user point of view that may deploy and configure DNSSEC with
      only the safest algorithm. On the other hand, comments and
      recommendations from this document are also expected to be useful
      for such users.</t>

    <section anchor="mustshouldmay" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      <t> We define some additional terms here:</t>
      <texttable anchor="tbl" style="none" suppress-title="true">
        <ttcol align="left" width="12%"/>
        <ttcol align="left" />
        <c>SHOULD+</c><c>This term means the same as SHOULD. However,
        it is likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be promoted
        at some future time to be a MUST.</c>
        <c>SHOULD-</c><c>This term means the same as SHOULD. However,
        an algorithm marked as SHOULD- may be deprecated to a MAY in a
        future version of this document.</c>
        <c>MUST-</c><c>This term means the same as MUST. However, we
        expect at some point that this algorithm will no longer be a MUST
        in a future document. Although its status will be determined
        at a later time, it is reasonable to expect that if a future
        revision of a document alters the status of a MUST- algorithm,
        it will remain at least a SHOULD or a SHOULD-.</c>

        <t> RSAMD5 is not widely deployed and there is an industry-wide trend to
         deprecate MD5 usage.</t>
        <t> RSASHA1 is widely deployed, although zones deploying it are recommended
         to switch to RSASHA256 as there is an industry-wide trend to
         deprecate SHA1 usage and RSASHA1 does not support NSEC3</t>
        <t> DSA is not widely deployed and vulnerable to private key compromise
          when generating signatures using a weak or compromised random number generator.</t>
        <t> NSEC3RSASHA1 is widely deployed. It has been marked as MUST- because RSASHA256
         is stronger and can be used with or without NSEC3.</t>
        <t> RSASHA512 is at the SHOULD level because it has not seen wide deployment.</t>
        <t> ECCGOST is at the SHOULD level because it has not seen wide deployment.</t>
        <t> ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSAP384SHA384 provide more strength for signature size than RSASHA variants. It is expected to be raised to MUST once it has been deployed more widely.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> The security of cryptographic-based systems depends on both the
      strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength
      of the keys used with those algorithms. The security also depends
      on the engineering of the protocol used by the system to ensure
      that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security
      of the overall system.</t>

      <t> This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
       algorithms for the use of DNSSEC, specifically with the selection
       of "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms. The algorithms identified in
       this document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known
       to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far
       leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the foreseeable
       future. However, this isn't necessarily forever and it is expected
       that new revisions of this document will be issued from time to
       time to reflect the current best practice in this area.</t>

      <t> Retiring an algorithm too soon would result in a signed zone with
       such an algorithm to be downgraded to the equivalent of an unsigned zone.
       Therefore, algorithm deprecation must be done very slowly and only after
       careful consideration and measurements of its use.</t>

      <t> DNSKEY algorithm rollover in a live zone is a complex process. See
        RFC RFC RFC for guidelines on how to perform algorithm rollovers.</t>
